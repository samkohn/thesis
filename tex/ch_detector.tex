\chapter{The Daya Bay Reactor Antineutrino Experiment}
\label{ch:detector}

The Daya Bay Reactor Antineutrino Experiment was designed
to be sensitive to $\thetaot \sim 0.01$
by performing a relative measurement of the rate of \nuebar{}
using a modular detector system arranged at near and far sites \cite{dybproposal2006}.
The experiment was located in southeast China,
approximately \SI{55}{\km} northeast of Hong Kong,
on the campus of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plants.
Groundbreaking for civil construction of the three underground
experimental halls occurred in October 2007,
and construction lasted approximately 4 years \cite{dyb_overview}.
The antineutrino detectors in the first experimental hall (EH1)
were ready for data taking on 11 August 2011,
and EH2 was ready on 5 November 2011.
With the completion of EH3, data taking began on 24 December 2011
and, with only brief interruptions,
continued until 12 December 2020.

The Daya Bay site is ideal for an oscillation experiment.
Its six reactor cores together form one of the most intense \nuebar{}
sources on Earth \cite{detector_system}.
The power plant campus is also located at the base of a mountain ridge,
providing an ideal location for antineutrino detectors that must be
protected from cosmic-ray muons without having to dig deep mines.
The tunnel layout allowed for easy access to the experiment via electric golf cart.

\section{Reactors and experimental halls}

Six pressurized-water nuclear reactors were used
as the \nuebar{} source for Daya Bay.
Each reactor had an output of \SI{2.9}{\giga\watt_{th}}
and combined they produced approximately \num{3.5e21}\,\nuebar/s \cite{ngd2016}.
The reactors are arranged in three pairs: Daya Bay, Ling Ao, and Ling Ao II.
The location of the cores determined the layout of the Daya Bay experiment.

The experiment was arranged into three experimental halls (EHs).
EH1 was located close to the Daya Bay cores (\SIrange{357}{372}{\meter}),
and EH2 was located close to the Ling Ao and Ling Ao II cores
(\SIrange{467}{558}{\meter}).
They are therefore known collectively as the near halls.
Their purpose was to constrain the \nuebar{} flux for the
relative oscillation measurement,
and they each contained two antineutrino detector modules (ADs).
EH3 was located farther away, approximately \SI{2}{\km} from the Daya Bay cores
and \SI{1.5}{\km} from the Ling Ao cores,
and was correspondingly called the far hall.
EH3 was located at the first oscillation minimum
for the oscillation controlled by $\Delta m^2_{32}$ (and $\Delta m^2_{31}$)
and its purpose was to measure the decrease in \nuebar{} rate compared to the near halls.
To increase statistics, EH3 contained four ADs.
The layout of the EHs with respect to the reactors is shown in \cref{fig:layout}.
The positions of the ADs and reactor cores were measured using
two independent surveying procedures: GPS for the above-ground locations
(reactor cores and tunnel entrances),
and a total station survey,
which was able to replicate the GPS survey to within \SI{4}{\mm}
and extend the surveyed area underground into the tunnels and EHs.
The baselines from each reactor to each AD are listed in \cref{tab:baselines}.
An uncertainty for each baseline of less than \SI{18}{\mm}
was assessed to have negligible impact on the oscillation measurement
\cite{detector_system}.

The EHs were located underneath a mountain, which provided a substantial
overburden to protect against cosmic-ray muons:
\SIlist{250;265;860}{\mwe} (meters of water equivalent),
respectively, for EH1, EH2 and EH3.

To accelerate the experiment startup timeline,
only six of the planned eight ADs were installed in 2011:
2 in EH1, 1 in EH2, and 3 in EH3.
This so-called 6-AD period lasted from 24 December 2011 until 28 July 2012.
The experiment was shut down while the remaining two ADs were installed
in EH2 and EH3.
The 8-AD period began on 19 October 2012.
At the end of 2016, EH1-AD1 was chosen to be repurposed as a test stand
for liquid scintillator studies for the JUNO experiment \cite{junoproposal2016},
and was decommissioned from Daya Bay on 20 December 2016.
The 7-AD period began on 26 January 2017 and continued through the end of
the Daya Bay experiment on 12 December 2020.

The ADs within each hall were collectively surrounded by a water pool,
which acted as a passive shield against natural radioactivity present in the rock
as well as an active veto for muons which penetrate through the overburden.
The water pool was covered by a resistive plate chamber (RPC) array
to provide additional sensitivity to incoming muons.
\Cref{fig:eh3_wp_photo} shows a photograph of EH3 during installation of the ADs,
when the RPC had not yet been moved into position to cover the water pool.
Also visible mounted to the near and far walls are two muon RPC telescopes
which were used for muon studies during detector commissioning \cite{muonsystem2015}.

\section{Antineutrino detectors}

The eight antineutrino detectors (ADs) were used to measure
the rate and energy of millions of \nuebar{} interactions with high precision
and low systematic uncertainty.
Each AD consisted of three concentric cylindrical regions
contained in an outer stainless steel vessel (SSV),
a cylinder with diameter and height of \SI{5}{\m}.
The innermost region was filled with \SI{0.1}{\percent} by mass
Gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator (GdLS).
The GdLS was contained by an acrylic cylinder known as the inner acrylic vessel (IAV).
The middle region between the IAV and the outer acrylic vessel (OAV) was filled
with (plain, undoped) liquid scintillator (LS).
The outer region between the OAV and SSV was filled with mineral oil
that served as a final passive layer of shielding around the LS region.

Two views of the nested AD configuration are shown in \cref{fig:ad_cutaway}.
The IAVs had a height and diameter of \SI{3}{\m} and were filled with \SI{20}{\tonne}
of GdLS.
The OAVs had a height and diameter of \SI{4}{\m} and were filled with \SI{20}{\tonne}
of LS.
The SSVs had a height and diameter of \SI{5}{\m} and were filled with \SI{40}{\tonne}
of mineral oil.
Each acrylic vessel was made of UV-transparent acrylic
and had a thickness of approximately \SI{1.5}{\cm}.

The liquid scintillator cocktail was designed to optimize the optical properties
and maximize stability over time \cite{gdls2014}.
Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) was used as the solvent and \nuebar{} target,
into which \SI{3}{\g\per\liter} of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO)
was dissolved as a fluor,
along with \SI{15}{\mg\per\liter} of the wavelength shifter
p-bis-(o-methylstyryl)-benzene (bis-MSB).
This LS was used to fill the OAV.
To dissolve Gd into the LS to fill the IAV, the chelating ligand
3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic acid (TMHA) was chosen for its ease of production
and its stability in solution with LAB.
During LS production, the approximately \SI{185}{\tonne} of GdLS for the IAV
was produced first,
after which the equipment was cleaned with a diluted HCl solution and purified water
so that the undoped LS could then be produced for the OAV.

Each AD contained overflow tanks to allow the liquid in each region
to respond to the slight expected changes in temperature and pressure.
ADs were also fitted with three automated calibration units (ACUs)
which contained radioactive sources and LEDs to help calibrate the ADs.
The ACUs are described in detail in \cref{ch:calibration}.

The mineral oil region contained the 192 8-inch Hamamatsu R5912
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that monitored the AD for scintillation light
(and, secondarily, Cherenkov radiation).
The PMTs were arranged in 8 rings of 24 PMTs on the outer edge of the mineral oil region.
Light collection and detector uniformity was increased by the presence of
specular reflectors located on the top and bottom faces of the OAV,
as indicated in \cref{fig:ad_cutaway}.
PMTs consist of a sensitive photocathode, from which an incident photon
can eject an electron by the photoelectric effect.
The photoelectron (PE) is accelerated in an electric field to the first dynode,
a charged metal plate, where it causes multiple electrons to be ejected.
A series of subsequent dynodes leads to an avalanche effect of electrons,
which are collected at the anode and read out as a voltage signal.
When discussing the strength of a PMT signal,
it is customary to use the term ``charge'' (measured in PE)
rather than ``light,''
though the charge collected by a PMT anode
is of course a proxy for the number of incident photons.

Before the ADs were filled with LS, GdLS, and mineral oil,
they were tested in a series of so-called dry runs \cite{dryrun1}.
The PMTs were supplied with high voltage
to verify the stability of the gain and dark rate.
The ACUs were deployed, and the calibration LEDs
were used to induce charge signals on the PMTs
to exercise not only the PMTs but also the front-end electronics,
the online DAQ system and the offline storage.
It was during the dry runs that the issue of PMT light emission,
or flasher events, was discovered.
These events must be filtered out from the data stream,
as described in \cref{sec:flashers}.

\subsection{Target protons}
\label{subsec:target_mass}

The number of target protons in each AD must be measured precisely;
a mis-characterization would lead to an unexplained excess or deficit
in event counts which could bias the measurement of \thetaot{}
in the same manner as a variation in detection efficiency.
Thus the number of target protons was treated as an effective efficiency
\begin{equation}\label{eq:target_protons_eff}
    \varepsilon_{\text{p},i} = \frac{N_{\text{p,\,AD }i}}{N_\text{p,\,EH1-AD1}}.
\end{equation}
When measurements from different ADs were compared,
the event rates were corrected by $\varepsilon_{\text{p},i}$,
which had the effect of standardizing to the number of target protons in EH1-AD1.

The number of target protons for each AD was computed from the measured masses
of each target volume
and chemical analyses of the proton mass fractions
of the materials in each volume.
The volumes were divided into GdLS, LS, and other,
which was dominated by the acrylic vessels (IAV and OAV)
but also included the reflector, hold-downs and radial shield \cite{acrylic_mass}.
Target masses for each AD are listed in \cref{tab:target_masses}.
The proton density in each detector volume
was computed based on the analytically-computed
hydrogen mass fractions of LS, GdLS and acrylic \cite{target_protons_technote}.
The final number of target protons was
simply the product of the target mass and the proton density,
summed over detector volumes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:target_protons}
    N_\text{p} = m_\text{GdLS} n_\text{p,\,GdLS}
    + m_\text{LS} n_\text{p,\,LS}
    + m_\text{other} n_\text{p,\,other}.
\end{equation}
The number of target protons for each AD
is listed in \cref{tab:target_protons}.
The uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the LS mass;
the relative uncertainty of \SI{0.37}{\percent}
is a sub-dominant contribution to the AD-uncorrelated
relative efficiency uncertainty
as listed in \cref{tab:efficiency_summary}.

\subsection{Observing Inverse Beta Decay}
\label{subsec:ibd_intro}

The IBD reaction, $\nuebar + p \to e^+ + n$,
created two signals with a characteristic
time delay between them, in a pattern known as a ``double''
or ``delayed'' coincidence.
When this reaction occurred in either the GdLS or LS region
of a Daya Bay AD,
the positron quickly deposited its kinetic energy in the liquid scintillator
and annihilated within $\lesssim\SI{1}{\nano\second}$
into two \SI{0.511}{\MeV} $\gamma$-rays
which also deposited their energy into the scintillator.
The combined light from the kinetic energy and annihilation $\gamma$-rays
was the prompt signal
and served as an effective timestamp for the interaction
as well as a proxy for the energy of the incident \nuebar{}.
The total prompt energy was related to the incident antineutrino energy
via the mass-energy conservation relation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prompt_vs_nu_energy}
    E_p \approx E_\nu - \delta m_{pn} + m_e \approx E_\nu - \SI{0.78}{\MeV},
\end{equation}
where $\delta m_{pn}$ is the mass difference between the neutron and proton.
Meanwhile, the neutron produced by IBD thermalized in the liquid scintillator
and captured on Gd (in the GdLS only) or on a proton in the form of \isotope[1]{H}
(in both the GdLS and LS).
This happened with a characteristic time of $\sim \SI{28}{\micro\second}$
in GdLS and $\sim \SI{215}{\micro\second}$ in LS.
The shorter time in the GdLS was by design,
due to the large capture cross section of a thermalized neutron
on a Gd nucleus compared to H (\SI{49}{\kilo\barn} vs. \SI{0.332}{\barn})
\cite{gdls2014}.
The term nGd is used to refer to the process of neutron capture on Gd
and the analysis of the data set containing nGd captures.
The analogue for neutron capture on H is nH.
For nGd captures, the excited nucleus
emitted $\gamma$-rays in one of two decay chains,
both of which had a combined energy of approximately \SI{8}{\MeV}.
The nH capture reaction $n+\isotope[1]{H} \to \isotope[2]{H} + \gamma$
produced a single \SI{2.2}{\MeV} $\gamma$-ray.
In either scenario, the $\gamma$-ray(s) deposited their energy
in the liquid scintillator.
The \SIlist[list-pair-separator = { or }]{8;2.2}{\MeV} signal
from the neutron capture on Gd or H, respectively, comprised the delayed signal of the
double coincidence.
This prompt-delayed coincidence pattern was an extremely efficient
discriminator for IBD events against a wide variety of sources of background.
The full IBD interaction and detection process
is depicted in \cref{fig:ibd_cartoon}.

        The thin black lines represent their trajectories
        through the liquid scintillator.
        The ``whisker'' marks indicate production of scintillation light.
    }
    \label{fig:ibd_cartoon}
\end{figure}

The LS region served an important purpose for the main nGd \thetaot{} analysis.
It significantly reduced the fraction of $\gamma$-rays from nGd capture
that escaped from the scintillating volume and distorted the energy spectrum.
The presence of the LS region allowed the entire GdLS volume to be
the fiducial volume, obviating the need to cut on the reconstructed position
of events, which would have added additional uncertainties to the analysis.
However, for the nH analysis,
a $\gamma$-ray produced by nH capture in the LS region
had a higher likelihood of escaping.
This risk was somewhat mitigated by the lower energy of the nH $\gamma$'s
(\SI{2.2}{\mev} vs. \SI{8}{\mev}).
The nH \thetaot{} analysis in this thesis accounts for escaping $\gamma$'s
through assessment of the delayed energy cut efficiency (\cref{subsec:delayed}).


\section{Water pools and muon detectors}
\label{sec:wp}

The muon detection system for Daya Bay consisted of
the water pool and the RPC system covering the water pool.
As data from the RPC is not used in the \thetaot{} analysis,
its description, along with extensive details of the entire muon system,
will be left to \cite{muonsystem2015}.
All three water pools were \SI{10}{\m} deep.
The near-hall water pools were \SI{10}{\m} wide and \SI{16}{\m} long,
while the far-hall water pool was \SI{16}{\m} in both dimensions.
These dimensions allowed the water pools to provide at least \SI{2.5}{\m} of shielding
to the ADs in every direction.
A cutaway diagram of the near-site water pools is shown in \cref{fig:wpcutout}.
Each water pool was divided using Tyvek(R) sheets
into optically-isolated inner and outer regions,
known as the inner water shield (IWS) and outer water shield (OWS).
Both the inner and outer water shields were instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
to detect the Cherenkov radiation from muons traversing the water.
The near-hall water pools each contained \num{288} PMTs,
and the far-hall water pools contained \num{384} PMTs.
A further breakdown is shown in \cref{tab:wp_pmts}.
\num{619} of these PMTs were newly-purchased \SI{20}{\cm}
model R5912 from Hamamatsu,
and the remaining \num{341} were \SI{8}{\inch} models 9350KA
and D642KB from EMI
donated by the MACRO experiment.
The IWS has been demonstrated to tag \SI{100}{\percent} of muons
that reach the ADs using the trigger thresholds described in \cref{tab:trigger}.

\section{Triggers and data acquisition}
\label{sec:daq}

Each Daya Bay AD PMT had a dedicated high-voltage (HV) coaxial cable
that supplied power to the PMT and returned the PMT signal to the
front-end electronics.
Upon receipt of an above-threshold PMT signal, these electronics immediately
issued a ``start'' signal to a TDC with \SI{1.6}{\ns} resolution,
and also measured the charge using a \SI{40}{\MHz} \num{12}-bit ADC
providing better than \num{0.1}-photoelectron (PE) resolution.
A \SI{50}{\percent} attenuated copy of the signal was passed to a copy
of the same ADC to allow for higher dynamic range in processing high-energy
events.
Refer to \cite{sidebyside,ngd2016} for the details
of the front-end electronics system.
The threshold to activate a single PMT channel's front-end electronics
was approximately \SI{0.25}{\pe}.
Once a channel was activated, the ADC values were buffered
awaiting a full-detector trigger signal.

The various detectors in an EH were triggered independently
by a master trigger board based on the conditions given in \cref{tab:trigger}.
The primary triggers for detecting \nuebar{}'s in the ADs were the NHIT and ESUM triggers.
The NHIT trigger was based on the number of PMTs simultaneously over threshold,
and the ESUM trigger was based on a simple sum of the photoelectrons
from each PMT.
The efficienies of the NHIT and ESUM triggers are shown in \cref{fig:trig_eff}.
Note that the trigger criteria are lower than the event selection
criteria used for the \thetaot{} analysis and described in \cref{ch:event_selection}.
Each channel's TDC was sent a ``stop'' signal when it received a trigger signal
from the master trigger board.
For every channel with a TDC reading of \SI{<1.2}{\us},
the corresponding TDC reading, peak ADC value and the pedestal ADC value
(the ADC output given no PMT signal)
were recorded into the offline storage system.
The absolute timestamp of the event was determined by a GPS-based clock
with \SI{25}{\ns} resolution and was also stored.
The resulting data files comprise the raw data from Daya Bay.
