\chapter{Event selection and backgrounds}
\label{ch:event_selection}

Data-taking at Daya Bay is broken into data runs
lasting approximately 1 day.
The precise start and end times are arbitrary
and are determined by the individual collaborator
on shift duty each day.
Each experimental hall (EH) saves data into independent runs.
Within each run, data files are saved containing 10 minutes' worth of data.
Approximately twice per year, new data is processed
using the calibration and reconstruction algorithms from
\cref{ch:calibration,ch:reconstruction}.
This data processing procedure is known as production, and the resulting datasets
are known as production datasets.
If the calibration or reconstruction algorithms are altered in any way,
the next production will re-process all of the historical data,
so that within a production dataset, all of the data was processed
with exactly the same software.
Since 2018, the calibration and reconstruction algorithms used in production have been
frozen so that new productions only need to process new data.
New algorithms are being developed that may be used
in a final data production after data taking ends in December 2020.
The production dataset used in the \thetaot{} analysis in \cref{ch:analysis} is known as P17B,
that is, the second production in 2017.

The event selection procedure applies a series of cuts to the data stream
to steadily increase the purity of nH-IBDs in the remaining data.
At each step of the event selection, it is critical that
differences in cut efficiency between the ADs are
minimized and quantified so that any observed near-far difference
can be attributed to \nuebar{} oscillations.
The removal of muons from the data sample, and the additional veto window
to suppress the rate of muon-correlated backgrounds,
are introduced in \cref{sec:muonveto}.
The removal of events caused by PMT light emission
is described in \cref{sec:flashers}.
In \cref{sec:coincidence}, the coincidence selection procedure
is introduced as a way to group events based on
the time separation of nearby events,
and the double-coincidence dataset is identified.
\Cref{sec:DT_cut} describes the cuts on coincidence distance and coincidence time
between the prompt and delayed sub-events that form each coincidence.
The characterization and statistical subtraction of
accidental coincidences of uncorrelated events
are described in \cref{sec:acc}.
\Cref{sec:energy_cuts} details the energy cuts
which remove additional background events
and nGd-IBD events, where the neutron captured on Gd rather than H.
The remaining backgrounds---muon-correlated unstable isotopes,
fast neutrons, and AmC neutrons---
are considered irreducible and are statistically subtracted
from the final energy spectra and rates
in \cref{sec:correlated_bg}.

\section{Muon veto}
\label{sec:muonveto}

The Daya Bay experimental halls are located underground
to help shield the ADs from muons produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays.
However, the overburdens of \SIlist{250;265;860}{\mwe}
for EH1, EH2, and EH3, respectively, do not block all of the muons.
When a cosmic-ray muon enters the LS or GdLS volume of the AD,
it creates a scintillation signal (and a smaller Cherenkov radiation signal)
that is proportional to the distance traveled
through the AD.
Given that in LS and GdLS, $\nicefrac{dE}{dx} \approx \SI{2}{\mev\per\cm}$,
even a muon that only traverses a small distance across the corner of an AD could easily deposit
more energy than the most energetic IBD interaction from a reactor \nuebar,
thus motivating event energy as a convenient discriminant for identifying muon interactions.
Additional muon tagging is provided by the water pool
surrounding the ADs in each EH (\cref{sec:wp}).
These pools are divided by opaque Tyvek sheets into inner and outer regions
which are monitored by PMTs for Cherenkov radiation from muons.

In addition to themselves creating background signals in the ADs
from their own energy deposits,
muons also create other sources of background.
A muon which enters an AD can produce
the rare unstable isotopes \li and \he (\cref{subsec:li9}).
These isotopes can decay through processes that exactly mimic the IBD signature.
A muon can instead interact with the rock surrounding the EHs
and generate energetic ``fast'' neutrons,
which can penetrate the water shield and stainless steel vessel surrounding the ADs
(\cref{subsec:fastn}).
If the fast neutron collides with a nucleus (particularly \isotope[1]{H})
inside the LS or GdLS,
the recoil could produce a prompt signal,
and the subsequent capture on H or Gd would produce
a delayed signal, again mimicking the IBD double coincidence signature.
Since these processes are highly correlated with muons,
an appropriate set of veto windows can greatly reduce their contamination of the data.

The muon veto window procedure consists of four independent criteria
for classifying muons.
Most muons reaching the ADs cause significant PMT signals in the inner and outer water shields.
Any event that triggered $>12$ PMTs in the inner water shield
is an inner water shield muon,
and any event triggering $>15$ PMTs in the outer wanter shield
is classified as an outer water shield muon.
A veto of \SI{400}{\micro\second} is applied to the data following
both types of water shield muons.
This veto is long enough to allow most (all but $\sim e^{-2}$)
fast neutrons that penetrate into an AD to be captured by H or Gd
before the end of the veto window.
Since the characteristic time between water shield muons at the near halls
was only around \SI{5}{\milli\second},
extending the veto window much longer would lead to a significant
loss of data efficiency.
Both of these criteria have essentially \SI{100}{\percent} efficiency
in detecting muons.

Since muons deposit much more energy in ADs than most other processes,
a simple energy cut is used to identify so-called AD muons.
Any AD signal with a reconstructed energy of \SI{>20}{\mev}
is considered to be an AD muon, and is followed by a veto window
of \SI{800}{\micro\second}.
Some muons deposit significantly more energy than
even the maximum expected for a minimum-ionizing particle in LS
traversing the entire AD, approximately
$\SI{6}{\meter}\times\SI{2}{\mev\per\cm}=\SI{1200}{\mev}$.
These events are assumed to be caused by muons which create particle showers,
explaining the additional energy deposits.
These particle showers produce a much higher rate of
\li and \he.
Because \li{} in particular has a long lifetime of \SI{257.2}{\milli\second},
the veto window for showering muons is extended to \SI{1}{\second}
to allow all but $\sim e^{-4}$ of the \li{} to decay before the veto window ends.
The residual \li and \he events in the dataset are characterized
and subtracted in \cref{subsec:li9}.

The muon veto also affects the coincidence selection
described in \cref{sec:coincidence}.
Briefly, if a candidate prompt event is followed
by both a candidate delayed event and a muon event,
then the coincidence pair is rejected as being too close to a muon event.
This avoids an unwanted correlation between muon rate
and coincidence distance-time (DT) efficiency (\cref{sec:DT_cut}).
Because of this implicit pre-muon veto window,
for a given coincidence time cut \tc,
an isolated water shield muon actually vetoes $\SI{400}{\micro\second}+\tc$
of DAQ live time,
an AD muon vetoes $\SI{800}{\micro\second}+\tc$,
and a showering muon vetoes $\SI{1}{\second}+\tc$
(\SI{1900}{\us}, \SI{2300}{\us}, and \SI{1.0015}{\s}, respectively,
for $\tc=\SI{1500}{\us}$).

When performing the coincidence selection, no events which are vetoed by muons
are considered.
Therefore, the measured rate of IBD events
must be corrected by an effective efficiency $\varepsilon_\mu$
accounting for the IBD events which were rejected along with the muon veto.
$\varepsilon_\mu$ is simply the fraction of DAQ time
that is not vetoed by any muon veto windows (including the pre-muon veto).
It is computed for each run as
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_\mu = \frac{\sum_i \Delta t_i}{t_{\text{DAQ}}},
\end{equation}
where $t_{\text{DAQ}}$ is the total time
between the first and last event in a run,
$i$ runs over all time intervals \textit{not} vetoed by a muon,
and $\Delta t_i$ is the length of interval $i$.
$\varepsilon_\mu$ should not be confused
with the fraction of muons which are identified by the muon criteria,
which is \SI{100}{\percent} \cite{muonsystem2015}.
The muon veto efficiency over time for the near and far halls
is shown in \cref{fig:veto_eff} for each data run.

%\section{Initial data preparation}
%\label{sec:dataprep}

%Before physics events are identified,
%major backgrounds that can be cleanly rejected are identified and removed.
%First, events with trigger types not used for the \thetaot{} analysis
%are discarded (see \cref{tab:trigger}).
%This includes random triggers, RPC triggers, and cross triggers.
%Second, cosmogenic muon events are identified
%and a time window after each muon is vetoed
%to allow for any spallation products or activated nuclei to decay
%without contaminating the IBD signal.
%\begin{itemize}
    %\item An IWS event with \num{>12} hit PMTs or an OWS event with \num{>15} hit PMTs
        %is considered a water shield muon.
        %All events in the subsequent \SI{400}{\us} are vetoed.
    %\item An AD event with $E > \SI{20}{\MeV}$ is considered an AD muon.
        %All events in the subsequent \SI{800}{\us} are vetoed.
    %\item An AD event with $E > \SI{2500}{\MeV}$ is considered a showering muon.
        %These muons have created particle showers within the AD,
        %and therefore have a higher probability of creating the activated nuclei
        %\isotope[9]{Li}, \isotope[8]{He}, or \isotope[12]{B}.
        %They occur infrequently enough that
        %all events in the subsequent \SI{1}{\s} can be vetoed
        %without a substantial decrease in livetime efficiency.
%\end{itemize}
%The full details of the muon veto are presented in \cref{sec:muonveto}.

%Next, occurrences of PMT light emission, known as ``flashers,''
%are also vetoed and removed from the data stream.
%These events are caused by sparking in the dynode of the PMT
%and have a geometrical signature in the pattern of hit PMTs.
%The flasher PMT itself observes a high amount of charge,
%as do the PMTs on the opposite wall of the AD,
%due to the directional emission of light from the flasher PMT.
%A cut based on the charge pattern is used to reject flashers
%with a negligible inefficiency for true IBDs.
%The details of the flasher cut are described in \cref{subsec:flashers}.

%Lastly, the vast majority of naturally-occuring radioactivity is rejected
%using an initial energy cut of \SI{1.5}{\MeV}.
%Since the oscillation minumum for Daya Bay occurs at $\sim\SI{3}{\MeV}$,
%this cut preserves the information needed for oscillation measurements.
%Even with low-energy events vetoed, a substantial number of
%uncorrelated radioactive decays are present in the final dataset
%and, when two such decays accidentally occur within a short time window,
%creat the accidental background, which will be discussed in \cref{subsec:acc}.

\section{Flasher events}
\label{sec:flashers}

\todo{Flashers section}

\section{Coincidence selection}
\label{sec:coincidence}

Events are grouped based on the number of other events
occuring within a given coincidence time \tc.
Each event with reconstructed energy above \SI{1.5}{\mega\electronvolt}
is identified as an ``AD event''
and is a potential coincidence candidate.
Because of the nonzero length of the DAQ readout window,
AD events occurring closer together than \SI{1}{\micro\second}
are not necessarily distinct physical events (see \cref{sec:daq}).
\todo{How frequently are 2 ``events'' so close?}
Consequently, during the coincidence grouping process,
the coincidence search window begins \SI{1}{\micro\second}
after the initial AD event.
Coincidence groups are constructed by repeating the following steps
(illustrated in \cref{fig:timeline_examples}) until the data file is exhausted \cite{thucoinc2015}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the next AD event.
        This AD event will be the ``prompt'' event of the coincidence group.
    \item Find all subsequent AD events within the desired coincidence time \tc.
        If a muon event is encountered within \tc,
        veto the entire coincidence group starting with the prompt event.
        (This additional vetoed time is accounted for in the muon veto efficiency.)
    \item Group these events together with the prompt event
        to form the coincidence group.
    \item Skip to the next AD event that is not part of the coincidence group.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{ch_event_selection/timeline_examples}
    \caption{
        An example timeline showing how coincidence groups are created,
        and how they interact with muons and muon veto windows.
        This illustration does not show the \SI{1}{\micro\second} gap
        at the start of each coincidence window.
        Windows 1, 3, and 4 are valid coincidence groups,
        while Window 2 is vetoed by the muon event.
    }
    \label{fig:timeline_examples}
\end{figure}

Because of the initial \SI{1}{\micro\second} gap,
the actual time interval covered by any given coincidence window is
$\tc - \SI{1}{\micro\second}$.
This analysis uses a coincidence search window of $\tc = \SI{1.5}{\milli\second}$.

The total number of AD events in the group
is the multiplicity of the group.
A coincidence group with multiplicity $n$ is also referred to
as an \fold{n} coincidence.
In Window 1 of \cref{fig:timeline_examples},
the first AD event starts a new coincidence window
that includes three other AD events,
resulting in a coincidence group of multiplicity 4, or a \fold{4} coincidence.

If a muon event occurs within a coincidence window,
then that coincidence window is vetoed.
Therefore every muon has an implicit veto window
that excludes prompt events within \tc{} of the muon.
This is demonstrated by Window 2 of \cref{fig:timeline_examples}.
Note that if the prompt event occurs earlier than \tc{} before a muon,
then subsequent events within the coincidence window
are allowed to occur inside of the implicit muon veto window.
Only prompt events are vetoed by the implicit veto window.

The veto window after a muon also impacts the coincidence selection process.
Window 3 of \cref{fig:timeline_examples} shows a coincidence window
whose prompt event is preceded by other recent AD events.
However, those AD events fall within the previous muon veto window,
so they are ignored for the purposes of forming coincidence groups.

If a prompt event has no subsequent AD events within \tc, it is
still a valid group, and is referred to as a \fold{1} coincidence.
Note that \fold{1} coincidences are somewhat but not strictly isolated
from other AD events.
Certainly there are no other AD events
within \tc{} \textit{after} the prompt event,
but there may be a \textit{preceding} AD event within \tc{}
if that event is part of a coincidence window
which ends before the prompt event in question.
Window 4 of \cref{fig:timeline_examples} demonstrates this property:
there are no other AD events within Window 4,
but there is a previous AD event within \tc{} of the start of Window 4.
Given the event rates at Daya Bay, this only happens in $\sim10^{-4}$
of single events.
This probability is derived in \cref{ap:singlesformula} as $P_b$.


\adgrid{All double coincidences found using $\tc=\SI{1.5}{\milli\second}$}{fig:double_coinc_raw}{ch_event_selection/double_coincs}

Once the coincidence groups have been constructed,
the set of \fold{2} coincidences
contains IBD candidates
with substantial background still present.
With a coincidence time of $\tc=\SI{1.5}{\ms}$
and a neutron capture time of $\sim\SI{200}{\us}$ in LS,
there is a negligible inefficiency due to neutrons
which take longer than \tc{} to capture on hydrogen.
\Cref{fig:double_coinc_raw} shows the prompt and delayed energy
of all \fold{2} coincidences identified each AD.
These plots clearly show the nGd events
at delayed energy values near \SI{8}{\mev}.
The nH events are visible as the narrow band at
delayed energies near \SI{2.2}{\mev}
and prompt energies of \SIrange{4}{7}{\mev}.
At prompt energies less than \SI{3.5}{\mev} or greater than \SI{7}{\mev}
these signal events are overwhelmed by the accidental background,
which is characterized in these plots by the 4-point square at both prompt and
delayed energies of \SIlist{1.5;3.25}{\mev}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{plot_diagnostics/mult_eff_near_bydate}

    }
    \label{fig:mult_eff}
\end{figure}
The set of \fold{1} coincidences is a subset
of the uncorrelated events, mostly radioactive decays,
that are also present in the data stream.
However, not all uncorrelated events end up in \fold{1} coincidences.
Sometimes an uncorrelated event will occur in close time proximity to
a true IBD prompt-delayed pair, creating a \fold{3} coincidence.
These high-multiplicity coincidence groups are vetoed
with a small loss of efficiency.
The efficiency of this multiplicity cut is derived in \cref{ap:singlesformula} as
\cref{eq:mult_eff_ap}:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:mult_eff}
    \begin{split}
        \varepsilon_m &= e^{-R_s \tc}
        \left(
            e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc} +
            \frac{R_s}{R_s+R_\mu} e^{-R_\mu\tc}
            \left(
                1 - e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
            \right)
        \right. \\
              &\ \ \left. - \frac{R_s}{2R_s + R_\mu} e^{-R_\mu\tc}
                  \left(
                      1 - e^{-(2R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
                  \right) +
                  \frac{R_\mu}{R_s + R_\mu}
                  \left(
                      1 - e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
                  \right)
              \right),
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $R_s$ is the rate of uncorrelated events,
$R_\mu$ is the number of muon veto windows divided by the muon-corrected livetime,
and \tc{} is the length of the coincidence window, \SI{1499}{\us}.
The multiplicity efficiency over time is shown in \cref{fig:mult_eff}.
More concerning is when two uncorrelated events
randomly occur in close proximity to each other,
creating a \fold{2} coincidence group that passes the multiplicity veto.
These so-called ``accidental'' coincidences
constitute the largest background within the set of \fold{2} coincidences
(\cref{sec:acc}).
The distance, time and energy cuts described below
are all motivated in large part by the need to reduce the accidental background.

\section{Distance and time cuts}
\label{sec:DT_cut}

The characteristic distance for a neutron capture on hydrogen
is approximately \SI{200}{\milli\meter},
and the characteristic time delay is \SI{150}{\us}.
For accidental coincidences, the characteristic distance is
the length scale of the AD, approximately \SI{3000}{\milli\meter},
and the characteristic time based on the \fold{1} event rate
is $\sim\SI{50000}{\us}$.
On the time scale of the coincidence window length $\tc=\SI{1500}{\us}$,
any particular coincidence time is equally probable.

\adgrid{Distribution of coincidence distance and coincidence
time\todo[inline]{Fix y axis tick labels}}{fig:dr_vs_dt}{ch_event_selection/dr_vs_dt}

\Cref{fig:dr_vs_dt} shows the distribution of
coincidence distance and coincidence time
for the subset of \fold{2} coincidences with
relatively small coincidence distances and times
of less than \SI{1000}{\milli\meter} and \SI{600}{\micro\second},
respectively.
The cluster at the lowest coincidence times and distances
consists of IBD events.
The rest of the events distributed with relatively uniform density
across the plot are accidental coincidences from uncorrelated events.
This plot was used to determine an ad-hoc distance and time cut
by drawing a line from \SI{800}{\milli\meter} at $0$ time
to \SI{480}{\micro\second} at $0$ distance.
This line effectively separates the higher-density region
of correlated events from the uniform density region of accidental background.
This cut is known as the DT cut and the line determining the cut has the equation

\begin{equation}
    \text{DT} = \Delta r + v_0 \Delta t < \SI{800}{\milli\meter},
\end{equation}
where $v_0 = \frac{\SI{1000}{\milli\meter}}{\SI{600}{\micro\second}}$.
Note that the quantity DT is not D$\times$T,
nor should it be confused the differential $dt$.
\Cref{fig:after_DT_cut} shows the individual AD spectra
after applying the DT cut.
As expected, the accidental background present
in the low-prompt-energy and low-delayed-energy corner has been reduced.
The neutron capture on hydrogen events now stand out much better
against the accidental background.

\adgrid{Prompt-delayed energy spectra after applying
the DT cut}{fig:after_DT_cut}{ch_event_selection/post_DT_cut}

Applying the DT cut rejects the vast majority of accidental events
at a loss of approximately \SI{30}{\percent} of real IBDs.
The efficiency is measured after subtracting the accidental background
(\cref{sec:acc})
by comparing the number of \fold{2} coincidences that pass the energy cuts and the DT cut
with the number of \fold{2} coincidences that pass the energy cuts
and a significantly relaxed DT cut of \SI{3000}{\milli\meter}:

\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_{\text{DT}} = \frac{N(\text{DT} < \SI{800}{\milli\meter})}{
    N(\text{DT} < \SI{3000}{\milli\meter})}.
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:ed_DT_sub} illustrates how the DT cut efficiency is measured
for each AD using a histogram of delayed energy and DT value
to determine the number of events which pass the nominal and relaxed DT cuts.
Negligibly few IBDs have a DT value anywhere close to \SI{3000}{\milli\meter},
so $\varepsilon_{\text{DT}}$ closely approximates the true efficiency.
The DT cut efficiency for each AD is shown in \cref{fig:DT_eff}.

        The black (dashed) box shows the events excluded by the DT cut.

        of subtracting two almost-equal large numbers as part of the

    \caption{The DT cut efficiency for each AD. Error bars are statistical.}
    \label{fig:DT_eff}
\end{figure}

The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty for the efficiency
is determined from the data by examining the variation
in measured efficiency between the 4 near-hall ADs.
The far-hall ADs are excluded because
their statistical uncertainties are much larger than the
near-hall AD variation.
The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of the DT cut efficiency
is the half-range of the near-hall efficiencies: \num{0.0016} (absolute),
or approximately \SI{0.23}{\percent} (relative).

\section{Accidental coincidences}
\label{sec:acc}

Once muon events and flashers have been removed from the data stream,
the vast majority of remaining AD events are caused by uncorrelated
natural radioactive decays and are commonly known as ``singles,''
although as will be shown shortly, this name is misleading,
and a more appropriate name is ``uncorrelated events.''
These events occur at approximately \SI{19}{\hertz} in each AD and,
because they are uncorrelated, their groupings in time follow Poisson statistics.
In particular, there is a nonzero probability that
two of these uncorrelated ``single'' events will occur within
$\tc=\SI{1.5}{\milli\second}$ and thus form a \fold{2} coincidence.
For any given uncorrelated event, the probability that
another uncorrelated event will occur within \tc{} is

\begin{equation}
    \text{Poisson}(1\vert R_s\tc) = R_s\tc e^{-R_s\tc}.
\end{equation}
For the above value for $R_s=\SI{19}{\hertz}$, this probability is \SI{2.77}{\percent}.
Since \fold{2} coincidence groups like this are not formed from any
deliberate physical proccess but rather by an accidental coincidence,
they are known as the accidental background.
Crucially, though almost all \fold{1} coincidence groups
consist of a single uncorrelated event,
not all uncorrelated events form \fold{1} coincidences.
These so-called ``singles'' are not always lone events.
A back-of-the-envelope estimate of the rate of accidental coincidences gives
$\SI{19}{\hertz}\times\SI{2.77}{\percent}=\SI{0.53}{\hertz}$
before applying the distance-time (DT) cut (\cref{sec:DT_cut}).

\subsection{Uncorrelated events}
\label{subsec:singles}

The full accidentals subtraction procedure begins with identifying
the rate of uncorrelated events in the AD, again better known
as the ``singles rate,'' for each individual data run.
The singles rate is computed by first measuring the rate of
\fold{1} coincidences in each run
(with the prompt energy bound of \SIrange{1.5}{12}{\mev}).
Given that rate, the true underlying rate of uncorrelated events can be
computed by numerically solving the following formula
(derived in \cref{ap:singlesformula}) for $R_s$:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rsingles}
    \begin{split}
        R_{\text{\fold{1}}}
          &= R_s e^{-R_s\tc}
          \left(
              e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc} +
              \frac{R_s}{R_s+R_\mu} e^{-R_\mu\tc}
              \left(
                  1 - e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
              \right)

\end{align}
In this formula, \tc{} represents the actual duration of the coincidence window,
which technically begins \SI{1}{\micro\second} after the event,
meaning that a value of $\tc=\SI{1499}{\micro\second}$ should be used (\cref{sec:daq}).
This formula is valid under the assumption that all \fold{1}
coincidences are formed from truly uncorrelated events.
Since the rate of correlated events like IBDs and other backgrounds
is \SI{<0.01}{\percent} the rate of correlated events,
this is an appropriate approximation to make.
The terms in brackets together represent the probability
that any given event does not fall in another event's coincidence window.
The leading term is simply the uncorrelated event rate $R_s$ times
the Poisson probability that no other uncorrelated event will occur
inside the given coincidence window.
The muon rate in this equation, $R_\mu$, is computed
by counting the number of muon veto windows in each run
after combining overlapping windows, and dividing by the muon-corrected
livetime $\varepsilon_\mu t_{\text{DAQ}}$.
Overlapping windows are combined and counted as a single ``muon event''
because when computing the counting statistics of single and coincident events,
the relevant quantities are the time until the next veto window begins
and the time since the last veto window ended,
neither of which changes if a given veto window
is composed of multiple muons.

The following scenarios can lead to overlapping muon veto windows.
First, a single physical muon can create multiple muon events
that satisfy up to three of the four muon criteria,
if that muon creates signals in the inner and outer water shields,
and also enters an AD and deposits at least \SI{20}{\mev} worth of scintillation light.
Such a muon would then be an inner water shield, outer water shield, and AD
(or showering) muon.
Second, multiple muons can occur in quick succession,
such that the second muon occurs within the veto window of the first.
Lastly, one muon could occur shortly after the end of a previous veto window,
so that the pre-muon veto of the later muon overlaps with the
post-muon veto of the earlier one.
For example, consider two water shield muons occuring within \SI{1900}{\micro\second}.
Taking into account the implicit pre-muon veto
and given that $\tc=\SI{1500}{\micro\second}$,
any event occuring between those two muons will never be
a part of any coincidence group, not even a \fold{1} group.
Any event occuring in the first \SI{400}{\micro\second} would be vetoed outright
by the water shield muon veto.
And any event occuring in the latter \SI{1500}{\micro\second} would open a new
coincidence window, but that window would contain the second muon,
thus vetoing the original event.

    }
    \label{fig:singles}
\end{figure}

The uncorrelated event rate $R_s$ for the near and far halls is shown in
\cref{fig:singles}.
$R_s$ was higher when the experiment began because long-lived
radioactive contaminants had not yet decayed away.
In particular, the far-hall ADs EH3-AD1, EH3-AD2, and EH3-AD3
were filled shortly before physics data taking began,
while the near-hall ADs EH1-AD1, EH1-AD2, and EH2-AD1
were filled and then studied for a few months
as part of detector commissioning, during which time
most of the radiocontaminants decayed.

Once $R_s$ is obtained, the rate of accidental coincidences $R_{\text{\fold{2}}}$
(before applying the rest of the event selection)
can be computed for each run
by simply adjusting the Poisson probability in \cref{eq:rsingles}
from the probability of $0$ other events within \tc{}
to the probability of $1$:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:racc}
    \begin{split}
        R_{\text{\fold{2}}} &= R_s\tc R_{\text{\fold{1}}} \\
                   &= R_s \left(R_s\tc e^{-R_s\tc}\right)
          \left(
              e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc} +
              \frac{R_s}{R_s+R_\mu} e^{-R_\mu\tc}
              \left(
                  1 - e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
              \right)
          \right. \\
          &\ \ %
          \left. - \frac{R_s}{2R_s + R_\mu} e^{-R_\mu\tc}
              \left(
                  1 - e^{-(2R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
              \right) +
              \frac{R_\mu}{R_s + R_\mu}
              \left(
                  1 - e^{-(R_s + R_\mu)\tc}
              \right)
          \right)
    \end{split}
\end{align}
The rate $R_{\text{\fold{2}}}$ obtained from this formula
cannot simply be subtracted from the measured \fold{2} rate
to obtain $R_{\text{IBD}}$.
Corrections still need to be made to account for
the coincidence distance and time properties of accidentals
as well as the energy spectrum
before the rates can be subtracted.

Like the rate computation, the energy spectrum of accidentals is determined for each run
by focusing on isolated events.
However, unlike the rate, a stricter isolation cut is used
to better ensure that only truly uncorrelated events are included in the sample.
This is acceptable because the characteristics of uncorrelated events
by definition do not change based on the presence or absence
of surrounding events.
A symmetrical isolation cut of $\tc=\SI{1.5}{\milli\second}$ is used
to ensure isolation before and after each candidate event.
The spectrum of these (now truly) single events is shown in \cref{fig:singlespectra},
obtained by summing the individual spectra from each data run.

\adgrid{Spectra of isolated single events in each AD.}{fig:singlespectra}{%
    ch_background/singles%
}

Uncorrelated events are not uniformly distributed
in position within the ADs.
Many of the radiocontaminants are on the surfaces of the
acrylic vessels that separate the mineral oil, LS, and GdLS regions.
To most accurately model the accidental background,
the singles sample is used to create a synthetic sample of accidental coincidences,
which is then used to actually perform the background subtraction
on the IBD candidates data set.
The synthetic accidental coincidence samples are formed for each run
by pairing up isolated events.
\todo{Update based on $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$ uncertainty requirements}
In particular, each isolated event is assigned an index in time order,
from $0$ to $N_{\text{isolated}}$.
Then each event $i$ from the first half is paired up with
the corresponding event from the second half, $i + \nicefrac{N_{\text{isolated}}}{2}$.
The coincidence distance is taken to be the actual distance
between the reconstructed positions of the two events.
Each event pair generates two synthetic accidental events:
one with the event from the first half of the run as the prompt event,
and one with that event as the delayed event.
For each ordering and for each event pair, a coincidence time is chosen
uniformly at random to match the coincidence time distribution
expected from true accidental coincidences on the short timescale
of $\tc=\SI{1.5}{\milli\second}$.
From this synthetic accidental coincidence sample, $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$,
the fraction of accidental \fold{2} coincidences which pass the distance-time (DT) cut,
can be computed.
And a prompt-delayed energy spectrum can be computed that only includes
synthetic accidental events which pass the DT cut,
as shown in \cref{fig:acc_sample}.
\adgrid[0.22\textheight]{
    Prompt-delayed spectra of the synthetic accidentals sample

    Each 2D plot is symmetrical under interchange of prompt and delayed energy
    by construction, since each synthetic pair is added to the histogram twice.
    The plots may not appear to be perfectly symmetrical
    due to artifacts of the plotting software.
}{fig:acc_sample}{ch_background/acc}

The resulting prompt-delayed energy spectrum of synthetic accidental events
can then be subtracted
from the prompt-delayed spectrum measured from real data.
For each run, the expected number of accidental events that pass the DT cut is

\begin{equation}
    N_{\text{acc}} = R_{\text{\fold{2}}} \times t_{\text{muon-corrected}}
        \times \varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}
    \label{eq:nacc}
\end{equation}
The synthetic accidentals prompt-delayed spectrum, represented as a histogram,
is scaled so that the integral is $N_{\text{acc}}$.
Then the histogram can be subtracted bin-by-bin from the corresponding histogram
representing the actual \fold{2} coincidence data sample.
The subtracted histograms are shown in \cref{fig:acc_sub_spectra}.
These distributions, projected onto the delayed energy axis,
are used in \cref{subsec:delayed} to determine the delayed energy cut bounds.

\adgrid[0.22\textheight]{

    are used to determine the delayed energy cut bounds
    and are shown in \cref{fig:delayed_fits}.
}{fig:acc_sub_spectra}{ch_background/sub_energy}

The scale factor for the accidentals spectrum histogram,
$\nicefrac{N_{\text{acc}}}{N_{\text{acc,\,synthetic,\,DT}}}$,
can be used to create histograms for other accidentals-subtracted quantities,
such as coincidence distance and DT, as well as 2D histograms of
those quantities' distributions with respect to prompt and delayed energy.
The accidentals-subtracted histogram of DT versus delayed energy
was used to compute the efficiency of the DT cut for IBDs in \cref{sec:DT_cut}.

The uncertainty assigned for the accidentals subtraction
is derived from two sources: $N_{\text{acc}}$ (\cref{eq:nacc}),
and $N_{\text{acc,\,synthetic,\,DT}}$.
The first of these is ultimately derived from
two measured statistical uncertainties,
on $R_{\text{\fold{1}}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$;
the second is itself a measured statistical uncertainty.
For a typical run that lasts 24 hours,
the statistical error on $R_{\text{\fold{1}}}$ is \SI{0.08}{\percent}.
By computing the derivative $\frac{\partial R_s}{\partial R_{\text{\fold{1}}}}$
to be $1.1$ for typical parameters in all 3 experimental halls,
a typical error for $R_s$ of \SI{0.088}{\percent} is obtained.
$R_s$ and $R_{\text{\fold{1}}}$ are almost \SI{100}{\percent} correlated,
so, referencing the first line of \cref{eq:racc},
the error on $R_{\text{\fold{2}}}$ is the sum of the errors
of $R_s$ and $R_{\text{\fold{1}}}$,
or, for the typical values cited above, \SI{0.168}{\percent}.
This value can be combined with the error on $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$
to obtain the uncertainty on the number of predicted accidental coincidences
contaminating each run's data, $N_{\text{acc}}$.

The uncertainty on $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$ is based on
the statistical uncertainty of the number of synthetic accidental events
which pass the DT cut given the fixed total number of synthetic accidentals:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}}{\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}}
    = \frac{\delta N_{\text{acc,\,synthetic,\,DT}}}{
        N_{\text{acc,\,synthetic,\,DT}}
    }.
\end{equation}
Most Daya Bay runs have $N_{\text{acc,\,synthetic,\,DT}}\sim10^3-10^4$
so the uncertainty on $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$ is approximately \SI{1}{\percent}.
\todo{Upgrade $\varepsilon_{\text{DT,\,acc}}$ to have a better uncertainty}

The events represented in the accidentals-subtracted histograms
are all correlated pairs
of a prompt event followed by neutron capture.
And if the delayed energy cuts from \cref{subsec:delayed} are applied,
then the remaining events represent correlated events
where the neutron capture was on hydrogen.
\Cref{fig:ncorr} shows the number of correlated events for each run
with the appropriate error bars as described above.
The total number of correlated events in each AD
along with the uncertainty, is listed in Table Y.

\section{Energy cuts}
\label{sec:energy_cuts}

\subsection{Prompt energy}
\label{subsec:prompt_energy}
The prompt energy lower bound of \SI{1.5}{\mev}
is chosen to exclude a substantial fraction
of the low-energy uncorrelated events from radioactive decays.
In particular, the electron capture process
${}^{40}\text{K} \to {}^{40}\text{Ar} + \nu_e + \gamma$
releases a $\gamma$ ray with energy \SI{1.46}{\mev}.
The high-energy tail of this interaction is visible in the prompt-delayed spectra
(\cref{fig:double_coinc_raw}) as an elevated bin content
along both the horizontal and vertical axes from \SIrange{1.5}{3}{\mev}.

The nominal efficiency of the prompt energy cut is estimated using Monte Carlo,
as described in \cref{subsec:thu_toymc_prompt}, to be\todo{Re-assess prompt energy
efficiency}.
Because of the energy dependence of the \nuebar{} oscillations,
a different fraction of \nuebar{} will pass this cut
depending on the baseline between the reactor and the AD.
For example, at shorter baselines, low-energy \nuebar{}
are more likely to oscillate to other flavors, so that at the near halls,
there are fewer IBD events missed by the prompt energy cut,
thus raising the efficiency of the cut.
At the oscillation maximum, though, medium-energy \nuebar{},
around \SIrange{2}{3}{\mev}, are most likely to oscillate.
So a smaller fraction of IBDs will pass the cut,
and the efficiency will be lower.

Corrections for each AD--reactor pair were computed
and weighted to arrive at each AD's final prompt energy efficiency.
Since the corrections to the efficiency depend on
the amplitude of \nuebar{} oscillations, they rely on knowledge of \thetaot.
(For example, there would be no correction at all if \thetaot{} were $0$.)
To compute accurate corrections and, more importantly, an accurate value
for \thetaot{}, an iterative process is used.
Initially, no baseline-dependent correction is used and
a value for \thetaot{} is obtained.
That initial \thetaot{} is then used to compute baseline-dependent corrections,
and the updated efficiencies are used to compute an updated value for \thetaot{}.
This process is repeated until the \thetaot{} result converges.
The correction factors for each AD are shown in \cref{fig:prompt_eff_osc}.

\begin{figure}
    \missingfigure{Plot showing corrections to prompt energy effiency}
    \caption{Corrections to the prompt energy efficiency due to \nuebar{} oscillations.}
    \label{fig:prompt_eff_osc}
\end{figure}

The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty for the prompt energy lower bound
is dominated by differences in the energy scale between ADs.
Based on the analysis of the delayed energy spectrum in each AD
reported in \cref{subsec:delayed}, the energy scale
varies by less than \SI{0.5}{\percent} between ADs.
By applying a \SI{+-0.5}{\percent} variation to
the event energy in the Monte Carlo dataset visualized in \cref{fig:prompt_eff_mc},
the impact of the energy scale differences can be propagated
to the prompt energy efficiency.
The impact, and therefore the relative uncertainty on
the prompt energy efficiency, is observed to be \SI{0.1}{\percent}.

There is also a \SI{12}{\mega\electronvolt} upper bound for the prompt energy.
The reactor \nuebar{} spectrum falls steeply above \SI{8}{\mev},
so this cut is determined to have \SI{100}{\percent} efficiency.

\subsection{Delayed energy}
\label{subsec:delayed}

Neutron capture on hydrogen (nH) releases a
\SI{2.22}{\mev} $\gamma$-ray,
which means the delayed energy cut bounds can be tuned to a narrow energy region
around that value.
However emitted $\gamma$'s occasionally
deposit less than their full energy in the liquid scintillator,
as shown in \cref{fig:prompt_eff_mc} by the extended low-energy tail
below \SI{2.22}{\MeV} and by the peak at \num{0} energy,
representing events where the $\gamma$-ray escaped entirely.
Both the tuning of the energy cut
and the fraction of escaping $\gamma$'s are sensitive to
small variations in the geometry of the AD, energy reconstruction,
and scattering properties of $\gamma$'s in
both liquid scintillator and in acrylic.

The delayed energy cut bounds are identified based on
functional fits to each AD's delayed energy spectrum.
The measured delayed energy spectrum is obtained by first applying
the prompt energy cut and DT cut,
then statistically subtracting the accidental background (\cref{sec:acc}).
Although the accidentals-subtracted spectrum is still not pure IBDs,
the only remaining background consists of correlated processes
where the delayed event is still
neutron capture on hydrogen, and thus does not distort
the delayed energy spectrum.

Each spectrum is fit with the calorimeter function, which models
a calorimetric response to a monoenergetic process with ``true''
energy $\mu$ \cite{calorimeter2016}.
The modeled detector has an intrinsic energy resolution $\sigma$
which applies a Gaussian smearing to the deposited energy.
($\sigma$ itself is independent of energy.)
The model accounts for some fraction $\alpha$ (the peak fraction)
of events being fully contained,
with the remainder of the events partially or fully escaping from the detector.
The energy leakage is modeled as an exponential distribution
with characteristic energy scale (or ``tail slope'') $\lambda$.
The fit function itself is derived by starting with
the unsmeared model:

\begin{equation}
    f_{unsmeared}(E;\mu,\lambda,\alpha) =
    \begin{cases}
        \alpha\delta(E-\mu) + (1-\alpha)\lambda e^{\lambda E}
        & 0 < E \leq \mu \\
        0 & E > \mu
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This function is then convolved with a Gaussian
of width $\sigma$.

\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
    f_{cal}    &= f_{unsmeared} \otimes \text{Gaussian} \\
    f_{cal}(E;\mu,\sigma,\lambda,\alpha) &= \int_0^\mu dE'
    f_{unsmeared}(E';\mu,\lambda,\alpha) \cdot \text{Gaussian}(E'-E; \sigma) \\
               &= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
               \left[
                   \alpha\int_0^\mu dE' e^{-\frac{(E'-E)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \delta(E'-\mu)
                   + (1-\alpha)\int_0^\mu dE' e^{-\frac{(E'-E)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
                   \lambda e^{\lambda E'}
               \right] \\
               &= \alpha\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(E-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
               + (1-\alpha)
               \frac{\lambda e^{\sigma^2\lambda^2+2\lambda E}}{e^{\lambda\mu}-1}
               \left[
                   \text{erf}
                   \left(
                       \frac{\mu-E-\sigma^2\lambda}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}
                   \right)
                   \right. \\
               &\ \ \left.
                   + \text{erf}
                   \left(
                       \frac{E + \sigma^2\lambda}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}
                   \right)
               \right]
    \end{split}
\end{align}
The entire result is normalized to unity
but can be scaled by an overall normalization $N$.

The eight delayed energy spectra with their fits are shown in \cref{fig:delayed_fits}.
Comparing the fitted parameters across ADs can be used
to measure the identicalness of the ADs.
Their values and relative differences are plotted in \cref{fig:delayed_fit_parameters}
and listed in \cref{tab:delayed_fit_params}.
In particular, the top-left plot shows the relative difference
in the fitted peak $\mu$ across the ADs,
which is a measure of the energy scale variation (\cref{subsec:rel_energyscale}).
The relative variation of \SI{+-0.5}{\percent}
is used to compute the AD-uncorrelated uncertainty
on the prompt energy cut efficiency.

The bounds for the delayed energy cut are computed
based on the fitted peak value and energy resolution
from the calorimter model. The energy criterion is

\begin{equation}
    \mu - 3\sigma < E < \mu + 3\sigma.
\end{equation}
This form was decided on even though the calorimeter function
is not symmetric, and even though in reality
the detector resolution changes with energy
(and therefore is not precisely modeled in the fit).
The values used for the energy bounds are listed in \cref{tab:delayed_bounds}
and plotted in \cref{fig:delayed_bounds}.

The absolute efficiency of the delayed energy cut
is measured using Monte Carlo.
The same fitting procedure is used to establish
delayed energy cut bounds of $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ for the Monte Carlo sample.
The efficiency is then the fraction of simulated IBD events
that pass the delayed energy cut.
Note that both the numerator and denominator of the fraction includes IBD events
where the the neutron captures on other nuclei, particularly Gd.
The relative fraction of GdLS to LS therefore impacts the efficiency
because with more GdLS, fewer neutrons will capture on hydrogen.
The estimated absolute efficiency for the delayed energy cut
is \SI{40}{\percent}\todo{Re-compute prompt and delayed absolute efficiencies}.
About half of the inefficiency is due to captures on Gd in the GdLS region,
and the other half is due to escaping $\gamma$-rays
from the LS (outer) region of the AD.

\end{figure}

The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty on the efficiency
includes variations due to all the above effects:
geometrical variations, energy scale, different material properties,
Gd fraction, etc.
The overall variation between ADs is estimated using a general method
that compares the relative size between the peak and tail regions
of the delayed energy spectrum, as defined by the delayed energy cut,
across the ADs.
Intuitively, if the same fraction of events is in the peak region in each AD,
then the cut efficiency must have a small variation.
This intuition is visualized in the cartoon in \cref{fig:delayed_eff_unc_cartoon}.
The ``expected'' curve has a high efficiency
and few events in the tail.
Since the ``different tail'' curve has more events in the tail region,
it can be concluded that this curve has a lower efficiency.

In practice, it is easier to compare the number of events in the peak
to the total number of events in an extended region that includes the tail,
rather than to just the new events in the tail.

For each AD's delayed energy spectrum, the peak region is defined as
the region passing the delayed energy cut, $\vert E-\mu \vert < 3\sigma$.
The extended region is the same for each AD:
$\SI{1.5}{\mev} < E < \SI{2.8}{\mev}$.
Using an AD-dependent definition for the peak region but
the same values for the extended creates
the desired sensitivity to variations in the energy scale.
Extending the lower bound down to \SI{1.5}{\mev} adds sensitivity to
anything that would change the shape of the tail
or the fraction of $\gamma$'s that (partially) escape from the AD.

If the delayed energy spectra have the same shape,
and if the calorimeter function is an appropriate fitting function
for determining the energy cut bounds,
then for some constant $b$ common to all ADs,
$N_{peak,\,i} = b N_{extended,\,i}$ for each AD $i$.
To test this model, an affine linear function is fit
to the values for each AD:

\begin{equation}
    N_{peak,\,pred,\,i} = a + b N_{extended,\,i},
\end{equation}
where $N_{peak,\,pred,\,i}$ is the fit function's prediction
of the actual event count in the peak ($N_{peak,\,i}$).
Plots of $N_{peak,\,i}$ vs. $N_{extended,\,i}$ and of the
relative deviation from the fitted line are shown in \cref{fig:delayed_eff_unc_fit}.
The fit value of $a$ should be $0$ if the simple model of
a linear scaling is correct.
Indeed, the fit value is $a = -323 \pm 387$
which is consistent with $0$.
The fit value for $b$ is $b = 0.9527 \pm 0.0015$,
which can be interpreted as a loose upper bound
on the delayed energy cut efficiency.
The final value for the AD-uncorrelated uncertainty
of the delayed energy efficiency is taken to be
the half-range of the relative deviations
of the near-hall ADs from the fitted line: \SI{0.11}{\percent}.
The far-hall ADs have much higher statistical uncertainty
(relative uncertainty $\approx\SI{0.5}{\percent}$),
and therefore larger fluctuations.
Validation that the far-hall ADs are not
substantially different from the near-hall ADs is obtained by
summing the counts for all 4 far-hall ADs to get
a combined relative deviation for the far hall of \SI{0.018}{\percent},
well within the uncertainty derived from the near halls.

This method for determining the variation in efficiency across ADs
does not account for every possible inefficiency.
For example, if the fraction of $\gamma$'s which totally or nearly totally
escape from the scintillating region is different in one AD,
but the distribution of $\gamma$'s which \textit{partially} escape is unchanged,
then this method would still suggest a high similarity between ADs.
An assumption of this analysis, therefore, is that any AD-to-AD variation
(in geometry, electronics, scintillator composition, etc.)
that affects the fraction of totally-escaping $\gamma$'s
would also change the fraction of partially-escaping $\gamma$'s.

\section{Irreducible correlated backgrounds}
\label{sec:correlated_bg}

After applying all coincidence, distance, time and energy cuts,
and after statistically subtracting the accidental background,
the sample of IBD candidates still is not pure.
The accidental background analysis by construction accounts for
all possible backgrounds that create single uncorrelated AD events,
but it is not sensitive to physical processes that produce
correlated prompt-delayed pairs.
These correlated backgrounds include muon-induced unstable isotopes (\cref{subsec:li9}),
muon-induced fast neutrons (\cref{subsec:fastn}),
and $\gamma$-rays from the Am-C calibration source (\cref{subsec:amc}).

The muon-induced backgrounds are particularly pernicious
because the near halls have higher muon rates than the far hall,
and thus an intrinsically higher rate of these backgrounds.
If the backgrounds are not correctly subtracted,
they will change the near-far ratio in a way that mimics the effects of \thetaot.

\subsection{Muon-induced unstable isotopes}
\label{subsec:li9}

Muon interactions with nuclei (primarily \isotope[12]{C}) in the AD
can produce the unstable exotic isotopes \li and \he.
These isotopes $\beta$-decay to neutron-unstable excited states
of \isotope[9]{Be} and \isotope[8]{Li}, respectively,
leading to a nonzero probability of a $\beta^{-}$-n coincidence.
Unfortunately, the $\beta$ energies lie in the range of IBD prompt energies,
so these \li and \he decays exactly mimic the signature of true IBDs.
